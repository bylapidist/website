In reality, I was a system degrading under constant load – just as any server or application will eventually crash under 100% CPU usage with no downtime. When my body finally gave out, it forced an immediate reboot of my life. Lying in a hospital bed, work was the last thing on my mind. I was facing months of recovery just to get back basic functions. This was the ultimate wake-up call: no deadline or project can ever matter more than your health. If you keep pushing until you break, the cost is unimaginably high."}]

31:["$","p",null,{"children":"Coming out of the hospital, I entered a months-long period of rehab and healing. Starting from the basics. Simple tasks I used to do on autopilot now required tremendous concentration. My brain felt slow, foggy. Typing an email or reading documentation for more than a few minutes left me exhausted. As someone who had always moved fast and juggled complex projects, this was frustrating and humbling. I had to relearn patience in a very literal sense, one day at a time."}]
32:["$","p",null,{"children":"In rehabilitation, progress was incremental. Initially, I measured success in very small wins: managing a short walk without fatigue, reading a few pages of a book and actually retaining the information, eventually doing a bit of coding practice to exercise my brain. Just as you can't refactor an entire monolith in one sitting, I couldn't \"fix\" my cognitive impairments overnight. I had to chip away step by step, trusting that consistency would compound into real results. This experience gave me a new appreciation for incremental progress – in both healing and coding. Whether you're recovering neural pathways or untangling spaghetti code, sustainable improvement comes from iterative, steady work rather than heroic overnight miracles."}]
33:["$","p",null,{"children":"In software, when you max out CPU or memory without relief, the system crashes or goes into a safe mode. Likewise, during rehab I learned that pushing myself too hard - mentally or physically - would set me back. My brain literally needed rest periods to rewire itself. In those early months, if I tried to force intense problem-solving or multitasking, I'd hit a wall. I had to respect my cognitive load limits. Interestingly, this made me reflect on my pre-stroke work habits: I often operated at 100% capacity, context-switching between meetings, coding, and emergencies with no downtime. It's no wonder I eventually crashed. Humans and systems both degrade under continuous max load - and both can recover if you dial back the stress and rebuild gradually."}]
34:["$","p",null,{"children":"I had firsthand insight into what it's like to struggle with tasks that \"should\" be easy. Progress isn't linear and everyone has off days. The perfectionism and constant urgency I used to carry were replaced with a focus on steady, sustainable progress. Ironically, by relearning the basics of taking care of myself, I became a better engineer and teammate than I was when I was \"high performing\" but burnt out."}]

36:["$","p",null,{"children":"One of the clearest lessons from my stroke recovery was that rest is not a luxury - it's part of the job. In the past, I saw time off, sleep, and hobbies as things you squeeze in around work. Now I schedule them with the same importance as meetings or coding sessions. Why? Because I learned that my brain is my primary work tool, and it needs regular maintenance. I used to push through fatigue; now I step away, knowing that a fresh mind will often solve in minutes a problem that a fried brain could barely fathom."}]
37:["$","p",null,{"children":"I also learned that saying \"no\" can be the most productive move. Before, I was a chronic over-committer - I'd accept unrealistic timelines, take on emergency tasks late at night, and generally try to be the \"yes man\" to prove my worth. It nearly killed me. During recovery, I simply couldn't do that - my capacity was limited, and I had to prioritise ruthlessly."}]
38:["$","p",null,{"children":"Surprisingly, the world didn't end when I pushed back on requests or asked for more time. Instead, something amazing happened: I found that setting boundaries earned me respect. By diplomatically saying \"I can't take this on right now\" or \"this deadline isn't feasible without risking quality,\" I opened honest dialogues with my team and managers. We'd re-prioritise or find another way. It turns out that being clear about your limits is healthy for both you and the product. As a bonus, it teaches your team that it's okay to set boundaries of their own."}]

3a:["$","p",null,{"children":"Before my health crisis, I viewed engineering leadership primarily as shipping features, refining architecture, and mentoring code quality. Those are all important, but my perspective broadened significantly after the stroke. I came to realise that one of the most critical roles of an engineering leader is protecting the humans who build the software. A team that is burnt out, stressed, or unhealthy will eventually grind to a halt, no matter how brilliant the individuals are. Conversely, a team that feels supported and balanced will sustain high performance and creativity. As a leader, it's my job to cultivate the latter and prevent the former."}]
3b:["$","p",null,{"children":"This human-centred mindset means I think about processes and culture as much as product and code. For instance, I ask myself: Are we setting realistic deadlines that respect weekends and evenings? Do engineers feel safe admitting when they're overwhelmed? Have we normalised taking time off and actually disconnecting? If the answer to any of those is no, I treat it as an urgent problem to solve. Engineering leadership, in my view, must include being a steward of the team's well-being."}]
3c:["$","p",null,{"children":"Another area I've doubled down on is building systems that reduce stress by design. As a design systems specialist, I've always been passionate about creating reusable components and guidelines to make developers' lives easier. I've become a big proponent of platform engineering - providing internal tools and automation that take cognitive load off engineers. For example, I created a self-service script for spinning up new frontend apps with our design system and CI already configured. This removed a bunch of tedious setup work and the anxiety of \"did I configure this right?\" for every new project. It's amazing how much stress you can lift from a team by streamlining the boring stuff."}]
3d:["$","p",null,{"children":"Design systems themselves, when done right, are a huge stress reducer. The goal of a good design system is to make the right thing the easy thing. Instead of every product team reinventing the checkbox or fighting over UX consistency, they can trust a well-documented component library. This cuts down decision fatigue and avoids the tension of last-minute UI inconsistencies. By building and evangelising these systems, I'm not just creating technical assets, I'm fostering a calmer, more predictable engineering environment."}]
3e:["$","p",null,{"children":"Before my stroke, I was laser-focused on technical excellence: writing clean code, enforcing best practices, optimising for scale, and chasing the latest frameworks. Don't get me wrong - I still value those things highly. But I used to emphasise the what (the output, the product) often at the expense of the how (the process and the people). After my recovery, I view every technical decision through the lens of sustainability. Now I ask: Will this choice make developers' lives easier or harder? Will it reduce cognitive load or add to it? For example, if adopting a new frontend framework adds significant complexity and stress (without a clear benefit), I'm much more likely to say \"no\" even if it's shiny and trendy. In contrast, I'll champion efforts that improve maintainability or developer experience, even if they don't directly deliver a user-facing feature, because I know those efforts pay off in team well-being and velocity."}]
