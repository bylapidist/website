# Disabled Link Buttons

When a `Button` renders an anchor via the `href` prop it cannot use the native `disabled` attribute.
Instead the component applies `aria-disabled="true"`, removes the element from the tab order with `tabIndex={-1}`, and prevents
navigation on click.

```tsx
<Button href="/example" disabled>
    Unavailable link
</Button>
```

Use this pattern for links that appear as buttons but are temporarily inactive.
