# Icon policy

Guidelines for using the shared `<Icon />` component:

- Prefer icons from the central registry instead of inlining SVGs.
- Size icons with the shared `Size` enum; avoid hardâ€‘coding dimensions.
- Provide a meaningful `title` for icons that convey information.
- Mark purely decorative icons with `decorative` so they are hidden from assistive technology.
- Reserve brand or illustration assets for image tags; the icon registry is for interface glyphs.

Refer to the [`<Icon>` documentation](../Icon/Icon.mdx) for API details.
