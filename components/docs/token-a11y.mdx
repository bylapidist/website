# Tokens and Accessibility

Design tokens keep styling consistent and accessible across the interface.

## Token usage

- Reference colour, spacing, and typography via CSS variables such as `--color-text` and `--space-md`.
- Avoid hardâ€‘coded values so themes and user preferences can take effect.

## A11y best practices

- Choose colour tokens that satisfy WCAG contrast requirements.
- Use spacing tokens to maintain readable layouts and comfortable tap targets.
- Apply the `--border-focus-ring` token to provide visible focus indicators.
