# Focus & Motion

The design system applies a consistent focus ring using the `--border-focus-ring` and `--space-focus-ring-offset` tokens. The helper stylesheet `styles/focus.scss` exposes a `focus-ring` mixin and global `:focus-visible` styles so components can opt into the same outline.

```scss
@use "../../styles/focus" as focus;

.button:focus-visible {
    @include focus.focus-ring;
}
```

Users that prefer reduced motion have transitions and animations disabled automatically. Avoid custom animations unless wrapped in `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`.
