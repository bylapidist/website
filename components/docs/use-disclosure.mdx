# Disclosure policy

Use the `useDisclosure` hook to manage toggleable UI like menus, drawers and accordions.

- Call `getTriggerProps` on the element that toggles visibility so `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` are applied.
- Call `getPanelProps` on the element that is shown or hidden.
- When a control behaves like a toggle button, add `aria-pressed` in the trigger props.
- Avoid managing open state manually; the hook centralises semantics and keyboard support.

See the [hook documentation](../hooks/useDisclosure.mdx) for a full API reference.
