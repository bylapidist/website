## Introduction

CSS layout is typically accomplished through physical properties: `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `padding-left`, `border-bottom`. These work fine if you only ever build left-to-right (LTR), English-language interfaces. But modern products do not have that luxury. If you want your interface to adapt to right-to-left (RTL) scripts such as Arabic or Hebrew, or vertical writing modes such as Japanese, physical properties begin to fail.

That's where logical properties come in. They describe layout in terms of the flow of content (block versus inline) rather than fixed physical directions. In this article, I will break down the differences, show real-world examples, and explain why I think logical properties should now be the default in design systems and enterprise frontends.

## Physical CSS properties: the old default

CSS originally defined margins, paddings, and borders with physical directions:

```css
.card {
    margin-top: 1rem;
    margin-right: 1rem;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
    margin-left: 1rem;
}
```

These map directly to the physical edges of the screen: `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`. The assumption baked into these properties is that content flows horizontally, left to right, as in English.

The problem? Interfaces are no longer limited to that assumption. For example:

```css
.card {
    margin-left: 2rem; /* Works in English, breaks in Arabic */
}
```

If your application switches to RTL, that `margin-left` suddenly appears on the wrong side. The fix traditionally involved conditional overrides:

```css
[dir="rtl"] .card {
    margin-right: 2rem;
}
```

This approach doubles your CSS, increases maintenance, and risks introducing subtle bugs.

## Logical properties: flow-relative layout

Logical properties were introduced to solve exactly this problem.[^1] Instead of coding for physical sides of the screen, you code relative to the flow of text:

- **Block axis**: the direction content flows in block layout (top to bottom in most scripts).
- **Inline axis**: the direction text flows (left to right in English, right to left in Arabic, top to bottom in vertical Japanese).

```css
.card {
    margin-inline-start: 2rem; /* Instead of margin-left */
    margin-inline-end: 2rem; /* Instead of margin-right */
    margin-block-start: 1rem; /* Instead of margin-top */
    margin-block-end: 1rem; /* Instead of margin-bottom */
}
```

These adjust automatically depending on writing mode. In English (LTR), `margin-inline-start` maps to `margin-left`. In Arabic (RTL), it maps to `margin-right`. If you switch to vertical Japanese, the same code applies margins at the top and bottom as expected.

You can also use shorthands:[^2]

```css
/* Margins on both sides of the inline axis */
.card {
    margin-inline: 1rem;
}

/* Margins on both sides of the block axis */
.card {
    margin-block: 2rem;
}
```

These work like `margin-left` plus `margin-right` or `margin-top` plus `margin-bottom` but in a flow-relative way.

## Why logical properties matter

1. **Global products**:

    Many enterprise SaaS and consumer apps eventually need to support multiple languages. With logical properties, you can write one set of CSS rules that adapt to every locale. No RTL overrides required:

    ```css
    .button {
        margin-inline-start: 1rem;
    }
    ```

2. **Accessibility and consistency**:

    Logical properties reduce visual bugs that occur when assumptions about text flow break down. They make codebases more predictable, especially in design systems consumed by teams across regions.

3. **Maintainability**:

    Instead of duplicating CSS for each writing direction, logical properties let you maintain one source of truth. This matters in regulated industries where UI consistency is not just aesthetic but compliance-critical.

4. **Future-proofing**:

    As CSS evolves, logical properties are positioned as the long-term model. Teaching new engineers `margin-inline` rather than `margin-left` helps them build global-ready UIs from day one.

## Examples in practise

Old way:

```css
.button {
    margin-left: 1rem;
}

[dir="rtl"] .button {
    margin-right: 1rem;
}
```

New way:

```css
.button {
    margin-inline-start: 1rem;
}
```

Vertical writing modes:

```css
body {
    writing-mode: vertical-rl;
}

.headline {
    margin-block-end: 2rem; /* adds space below text in vertical flow */
}
```

This works automatically in Japanese or Mongolian text layouts, where vertical writing is common.[^3]

## Browser support and adoption

Logical properties are well-supported in modern browsers. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge all implement them. You can use them today.[^5]

## My takeaways

As a design system engineer, I think we should treat logical properties as the baseline. They reduce risk and create components that adapt to multiple contexts with zero overrides. This ensures consistency across components and languages, and make your design system adapt to multiple locales for free!

Guidelines I recommend from my dig into this topic:

1. Default to logical properties in tokens, utilities, and component styles.
2. Abstract into spacing utilities that teams can use without worrying about writing mode.
3. Educate teams: explain not just how to use them, but why they matter.

## Migration strategy for legacy code

Migrating large CSS codebases is non-trivial. Here is a phased approach:

1. Audit your CSS for physical properties (`margin-left`, `padding-right`, etc.).
2. Prioritise high-risk areas: components used in forms, navigation, or disclaimers in internationalised flows.
3. Introduce linting rules via Stylelint to flag new physical property usage.
4. Refactor gradually, starting with shared components in your design system.
5. Educate engineers: provide docs and code examples in your internal design system guidelines.

Codemods or search/replace scripts can help accelerate this process.

## Future outlook

Logical properties are still "new" to many engineers, but they are no longer experimental. The CSSWG spec defines them as part of the core language.[^4] As localisation and accessibility become baseline requirements, logical properties will replace physical properties in:

- CSS frameworks (e.g. Tailwind introduced partial support in v4)[^6]
- Component libraries (Material UI, Radix)
- Education and tutorials

## Conclusion

Physical CSS properties (`margin-left`, `margin-top`) were designed for a world where text flowed one way. Logical properties (`margin-inline`, `margin-block`) are designed for a global web. They adapt automatically to different writing modes, simplify your code, and reduce risk in internationalised interfaces.

The ultimate goal of inclusive engineering is to ensure access to as wide a range of people as possible. We should start thinking of internationalisation as a core part of the wider umbrella of accessibility. If you maintain a design system or enterprise frontend, adopting logical properties is not just nice to have - it is strategic engineering. They make your platform more resilient, accessible, and ready for expansion into multiple locales.
